## This module handles interacting with the DSP card that sends the digital and
# analog signals that control our light sources, cameras, and piezos. In 
# particular, it effectively is solely responsible for running our experiments.
# As such it's a fairly complex module. 
# 
# A few helpful features that need to be accessed from the commandline:
# 1) A window that lets you directly control the digital and analog outputs
#    of the DSP.
# >>> import devices.dsp as DSP
# >>> DSP.makeOutputWindow()
#
# 2) Create a plot describing the actions that the DSP set up in the most
#    recent experiment profile.
# >>> import devices.dsp as DSP
# >>> DSP._deviceInstance.plotProfile()
#
# 3) Manually advance the SLM forwards some number of steps; useful for when
#    it has gotten offset and is no longer "resting" on the first pattern.
# >>> import devices.dsp as DSP
# >>> DSP._deviceInstance.advanceSLM(numSteps)
# (where numSteps is an integer, the number of times to advance it).
#
# Sample config entry:
#  [dsp]
#  type: LegacyDSP
#  uri: PYRO:pyroDSP@somehost:8001
