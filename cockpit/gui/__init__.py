"""This package contains all the UI for Cockpit.

All of the widgets that are not created by specific devices live here
--- the mosaic, macro stage view, camera window, etc.  The different
GUI windows and widgets automatically adjust themselves based on the
number and capabilities of the hardware available.

Some of subpackages are:

- :mod:`cockpit.gui.camera`: handles the display of images received
  from the camera(s).  It depends heavily on the
  :mod:`cockpit.gui.imageViewer`.

- :mod:`cockpit.gui.dialogs`: contains all dialog subclasses and any
  widgets that are specific to them.  This includes the experiment
  setup dialogs.

- :mod:`cockpit.gui.imageViewer`: generic code for displaying pixel
  arrays to the screen.  It includes a histogram for black/white
  scaling, zoom and drag, etc.

- :mod:`cockpit.gui.macroStage`: the Macro Stage window gives the user
  a high-level overview of where they are with respect to the motion
  limits of their stage.

- :mod:`cockpit.gui.mosaic`: the mosaic provides a UI to map out the
  user's sample in detail.  It consists of a large OpenGL canvas and
  some associated buttons.

And some of its modules are:

- :mod:`cockpit.gui.fileViewerWindow`: displays MRC files; this code
  is invoked when an MRC file is dragged onto the main window.

- :mod:`cockpit.gui.guiUtils`: utility functions for setting up and
  running the UI.

- :mod:`cockpit.gui.keyboard`: binds keyboard shortcuts to windows.

- :mod:`cockpit.gui.loggingWindow`: displays standard output and
  standard error.

- :mod:`cockpit.gui.mainWindow`: shows exposure settings, the
  run-experiment buttons, and any custom UI created by device code.

    GUI elements must beget instances of :class:`EvtEmitter` for each
    cockpit event they are interested in subscribing, and then bind
    whatever to :const:`EVT_COCKPIT` events.  Like so::

      abort_emitter = cockpit.gui.EvtEmitter(window, cockpit.events.USER_ABORT)
      abort_emitter.Bind(cockpit.gui.EVT_COCKPIT, window.OnUserAbort)

    This ensures that cockpit events are handled in a wx compatible
    manner.  We can't have the GUI elements subscribe directly to
    :mod:`cockpit.events` because:

    1. The function or method used for subscription needs to be called
    on the main thread since wx, like most GUI toolkits, is not thread
    safe.

    2. unsubscribing is tricky.  wx objects are rarely destroyed so we
    can't use the destructor.  Even :meth:`wx.Window.Destroy` is not
    always called.
