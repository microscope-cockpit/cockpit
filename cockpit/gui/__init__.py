class EvtEmitter(wx.EvtHandler):
    """Receives :mod:`cockpit.events` and emits a custom :class:`wx.Event`.

    GUI elements must beget instances of :class:`EvtEmitter` for each
    cockpit event they are interested in subscribing, and then bind
    whatever to :const:`EVT_COCKPIT` events.  Like so::

      abort_emitter = cockpit.gui.EvtEmitter(window, cockpit.events.USER_ABORT)
      abort_emitter.Bind(cockpit.gui.EVT_COCKPIT, window.OnUserAbort)

    This ensures that cockpit events are handled in a wx compatible
    manner.  We can't have the GUI elements subscribe directly to
    :mod:`cockpit.events` because:

    1. The function or method used for subscription needs to be called
    on the main thread since wx, like most GUI toolkits, is not thread
    safe.

    2. unsubscribing is tricky.  wx objects are rarely destroyed so we
    can't use the destructor.  Even :meth:`wx.Window.Destroy` is not
    always called.
