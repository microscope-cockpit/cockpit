# in experiment/zStack.py; the generateActions() function in that class is
# what collects the actual data. We just modify the execute() function
# (inherited from the base Experiment class in experiment/experiment.py) to
# engage the lights as specified before each rep.
# See below this class for the ExperimentUI and OptoPanel classes that set
# up the UI for configuring the experiment settings.
