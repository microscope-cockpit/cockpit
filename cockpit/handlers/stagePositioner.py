## This handler is for stage positioner devices.
class PositionerHandler(deviceHandler.DeviceHandler):
    ## callbacks should fill in the following functions:
    # - moveAbsolute(axis, position): Move the axis to the
    #   given position, in microns.
    # - moveRelative(axis, delta): Move the axis by the specified
    #   delta, in microns.
    # - getPosition(axis): Get the position for the specified axis.
    # Additionally, if the device is to be used in experiments, it must have:
    # - getMovementTime(axis, start, end): Get the amount of time it takes to 
    #   move from start to end and then stabilize.
    # \param axis A numerical indicator of the axis (0 = X, 1 = Y, 2 = Z).
    # \param hardLimits A (minPosition, maxPosition) tuple indicating
    #        the device's hard motion limits.
    # \param softLimits Default soft motion limits for the device. Defaults
    #        to the hard limits.
