## This serves as the base class for any Device subclass. Devices are as close
# as MUI gets to speaking directly to hardware. Device implementation is 
# largely left up to the client; this class simply provides a framework of 
# stub functions that must be implemented.

        # initialized on startup.

        # are initialized first. This is useful if you have Devices that 
        # rely on other Devices.

    ## Perform any necessary initialization (e.g. connecting to hardware).

    # we are responsible for. Each DeviceHandler represents an abstract bit
    # of hardware -- for example, a generic camera, or a stage mover along
    # a single axis, or a light source. Take a look at the 
    # "handlers/deviceHandler.py" file for more information.

    ## Construct any special UI the Device needs. Most Devices will not need
    # to do anything here, but if you have settings that the user needs to be
    # able to manipulate and that the normal UI will not handle, then this 
    # is where you create your specific UI.

    #         window, or None if nothing is to be inserted.

    ## Subscribe to any events we care about.

    # have been generated, so they are able to respond to these publications.

    ## Do any final actions needed, now that all of the devices are set up
    # and all initial publications and subscriptions have been made.
