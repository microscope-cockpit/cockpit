Cockpit does not yet have a release and is not available on PyPI.  It
can however, be installed from development sources::

    git clone git@github.com:MicronOxford/cockpit.git
    cd cockpit
    python setup.py install

Cockpit `setup.py` script will automatically check and install its
Python dependencies.  Its main dependencies are microscope, numpy,
PyOpenGL, Pyro4, and wxPython.

The only non Python dependency is `FTGL
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl/>`_ which needs to be installed
separately.


==Developer install instructions==

===Macos==

Macos needs git and python3 which are not part of the default
setup. There are various route to get these two packages but below are
instructions for how to do this via homebrew.

Install Homebrew from https://brew.sh/ currently this involves starting
a terminal (/Applications/Utilities/terminal.app) and running the command

 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

then use homebrew to install git and python3 and ftgl

 brew install git

 brew install python3

 brew install ftgl

Create a directory for microscope and cockpit, I used ~/src

 mkdir ~/src
 cd ~/src

Next clone the github respoitories.

 git clone https://github.com/MicronOxford/microscope.git
 git clone https://github.com/MicronOxford/cockpit.git

Setup these packages as a developer

 cd microscope
 python3 setup.py develop

For me this failed as I didn't have write access to the python library
directory /Library/Python/3.7/site-packages. I had to create this
directory and change its ownership to my userid. As this is a laptop
and I am the only user this shouldn't be a problem.

 sudo mkdir /Library/Python/3.7
 sudo chown <username> /Library/Python/3.7
 mkdir /Library/Python/3.7/site-packages

then so the setup again.

 python3 setup.py develop

Finally install cockpit in the same way

 cd ../cockpit
 python3 setup.py develop

Then test

 cockpit

This should start the cockpit GUI.
