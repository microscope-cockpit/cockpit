Cockpit does not yet have a release and is not available on PyPI.  It
can however, be installed from development sources::

    git clone git@github.com:MicronOxford/cockpit.git
    cd cockpit
    python setup.py install

Cockpit `setup.py` script will automatically check and install its
Python dependencies.  Its main dependencies are microscope, numpy,
PyOpenGL, Pyro4, and wxPython.

The only non Python dependency is `FTGL
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl/>`_ which needs to be installed
separately.
