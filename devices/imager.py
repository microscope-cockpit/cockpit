## This module provides a Device that is used to take images with our dummy
# camera. Ordinarily this functionality would be covered by some kind of 
# signal source (e.g. an FPGA or DSP card).

    # reloaded via the depot.reloadModule() function. These two functions
    # need to be implemented for this to work properly.
