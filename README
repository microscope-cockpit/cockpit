Cockpit is a microscope graphical user interface.  It is a flexible
and easy to extend platform, aimed at life scientists using bespoke
microscopes.  Its main features are::

* Easy to use and extend by life scientists.  Cockpit is completely
  written in Python and meant to be extended by the user.

* Very fast device control and time precision.  During experiments,
  devices are controlled via hardware signals.

* Distributed microscope devices.  Cockpit is designed around the idea
  that the multiple devices that make a microscope can be split across
  multiple computers.

* Independent of the actual devices being used.  Cockpit uses Python's
  `Microscope<https://github.com/MicronOxford/microscope>`_ package to
  control the devices.  The graphical interface and experiments
  automatically adjust to the  existing devices.

* Cross Platform.  Cockpit can run on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

* Cockpit is free and open source software, released under the GPL.


Cockpit is not yet distributed via in PyPI but can easily be installed
from development sources::

    git clone git@github.com:MicronOxford/cockpit.git
    python3 setup.py install
