## This class serves as an example of how to run an immediate-mode
# experiment. Make a copy of this file, and modify it to have the logic
# you want. To run it (supposing that your copy is in
# experiment/myExperiment.py), do this in the Python shell in the Cockpit:
# >>> import experiment.myExperiment
# >>> runner = experiment.myExperiment.MyExperiment()
# >>> runner.run()
# If you make changes to the experiment while the cockpit is running, you will
# need to reload the experiment module for those changes to take effect:
# >>> reload(experiment.myExperiment)
